# My Dotfiles
These are my dotfile configuration files for different software in Bash.
## .vimrc
This is my custom .vimrc configuration for Vim.
## .bashrc
This is my custom .bashrc configuration for Bash.

I have created two scripts inside of bin. And you can run those scripts using make: linux, or make: clean. make will run the default (linux). Scripts check what O.S you are running and outputs that to a file that will be created after the script is ran.
